# This file is automatically deployed to your FiveM server by the CAD when
# FIVEM_SERVER_PATH is set in .env. It will be written alongside your
# server.cfg as voice.cfg and overwritten on every CAD restart to stay
# in sync.

# Replace 103.203.241.35 with your VPS public IP.
# Port 64738 must be open TCP+UDP in Windows Firewall and your VPS
# provider's security group.

# Audio mode — voice_use2dAudio prevents pma-voice auto-overriding to
# voice_useNativeAudio. With rust-mumble (the CAD's built-in voice server),
# proximity voice targets work correctly regardless of audio mode setting.
# voice_use2dAudio gives flat-volume proximity (recommended for roleplay).
